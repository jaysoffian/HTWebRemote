DIVA RS232 AND IP/TELNET COMMAND LIST 

Diva RS232 jack expects the following plug signals: 
TIP  = TX [sends data out from Diva]
RING = RX [receives data to Diva]
SLEEVE = GND

Parameters: 19200, n, 8, 1, no handshake

If using RS232, each command must start with #diva header and must end with a carriage return \r or a newline \n
If using IP/TELNET each command must end with a carriage return \r or a newline \n but there is no need for the #diva header.

Each response will have both carriage return \r and a newline \n added in the format <cr><lf>

Diva default IP port is 2210. e.g. 192.168.1.100:2210

Use only lowercase characters

typical 'close connection' character either ESC (0x1b) or ETX (0x03) or -1 or use some low level internal FIN markup for TCP/IP



A generic RS232 command to write a value:
#diva set x y
where #diva is the header and all commands start with this header
set - indicates value will be written to diva
x - target to be written
y - value or values

A generic RS232 command to read a value:
#diva get x 
where #diva is the header and all commands start with this header
get - indicates value will be read from diva
x - target to be read

A generic IP command is as above without the #diva header

The get-command generally first returns the command name and then the value.

Command list [current set-values can be read with the get-command]:
