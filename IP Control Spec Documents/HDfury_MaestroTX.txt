MAESTRO RS232 AND IP/TELNET COMMAND LIST 

Maestro RS232 jack expects the following plug signals: 
TIP  = TX [sends data out from Maestro]
RING = RX [receives data to Maestro]
SLEEVE = GND

Parameters: 19200, n, 8, 1, no handshake

Every command is routed to the RX RS232 as well as the local Maestro control.
If using RS232 to control Maestro TX each command must start with #maestro header and must end with a carriage return \r or a newline \n
If using IP/TELNET, there is no need for the #maestro header.

Each response will have both carriage return \r and a newline \n added in the format <cr><lf>

MaestroTX default IP port is 2200. e.g. 192.168.1.100:2200
MaestroRX default IP port is 2201. e.g. 192.168.1.124:2201

Use only lowercase characters

A generic command to write a value:
#maestro set x y
where #maestro is the header and all commands start with this header
set - indicates value will be written to maestro
x - target to be written
y - value or values

A generic command to read a value:
#maestro get x 
where #maestro is the header and all commands start with this header
get - indicates value will be read from maestro
x - target to be read

A generic IP command is as above without the #maestro header

The get-command generally first returns the command name and then the value.

Command list [current set-values can be read with the get-command]:
